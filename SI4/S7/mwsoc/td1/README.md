# Java-RMI-Example

A simple example of a Java-RMI setup using Maven

## Project Setup

There are three subprojects in this example: RMIClient, RMIServer, and RMIInterfaces. These should be self-explanatory.
The server sets up a basic class to be used as a remote object. The client then connects to it. Since both the client
and the server need to be able to know the definition of the interface, that is broken out into a separate project that
they both have as a dependency.

This project should build out of the box with Maven.

## Running the project

Running this can be a somewhat involved task, but here's the simple way to do it:

1. Run the rmiregistry program. This should be in
   $JAVA_HOME/bin.  ``rmiregistry -J-Djava.rmi.server.useCodebaseOnly=false``
2. Run the RMIServer. Make sure that when setting the RMI server codebase, the path ends with a /, otherwise **it will
   not work
   **.  ``java -Djava.rmi.server.useCodebaseOnly=false -Djava.rmi.server.codebase=file:C:\path\to\classes\ server.Server``
3. Run the RMIClient. Make sure that when setting the RMI server codebase, the path ends with a /, otherwise **it will
   not work**. Also ensure that client.policy is accessible by the
   application.  ``java -Djava.rmi.server.useCodebaseOnly=false -Djava.rmi.server.codebase=file:C:\path\to\classes\ -Djava.security.policy=client.policy client.Client``

Everything should now come up and you should see a message in the server window. The client prints out the number of
characters that it sent to the server.
